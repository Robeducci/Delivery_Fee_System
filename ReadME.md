##DELIVERY FEE CALCULATOR
_____

### Problems:
Problem when configuring root project - This project uses Java 17, make sure your JAVA_HOME or Gradle JVM is set to 17.

In Intellij you can change it under:  
`File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle > Gradle JVM` 

After this the project should configure correctly.
____
### Running the project:
`.\gradlew clean` (Optional)   
`.\gradlew build`  
`.\gradlew bootRun`  

Now go to `localhost:8080` and you can start calculating delivery fees.
